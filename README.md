## How can I install and use this?
0. Watch the tutorial: https://youtu.be/xPEZBK1SaUk
1. Git-clone this repo & change directory

   <pre>git clone https://github.com/Ashwin-Iyer1/tiktodv4.git</pre>
   <pre>cd tiktodv4</pre>
2. Install modules using pip:
   <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
3. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed
4. Run the .py file!
   <pre>python tiktodv4.py</pre>
   
   **You will get "error trying again" when it runs because it is waiting for the timer. If it goes on for more than 4 minutes then please make an issue request.

## Note
The first recaptcha has to be completed manually.
